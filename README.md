Project description

PIGENDEF is a research project that bundles the expertise of three research partners and five SME partners in order to find genes and mutations underlying congenital genetic defects in pigs. 
logo pigendefCongenital diseases are quite common in swine and cover a range of conditions. The most important congenital genetic defects that occur in piglets are hernias (umbilical hernia and inguinal or scrotal hernias), cryptorchidism and splay legs, and to a lesser extent intersexuality, anal atresia and progressive ataxia and spastic paresis. All together, these disorders affect on average 3% of pigs in commercial populations worldwide. In Europe the economic loss due to these congenital defects is estimated at 200 million euros per year. However, besides the economic loss, these defects also have a serious impact on animal welfare and health. Some of the defects cause direct piglet mortality, while others lead to culling of piglets. 
This project focuses on the rapid identification of genes underlying congenital disorders, more specifically umbilical and scrotal hernias and cryptorchidism, in pigs for effective marker assisted selection (MAS) against these defects. For most of these defects there are strong indications for a genetic component and different research groups all over Europe have made efforts to find the underlying causative genetic mechanisms. However, the mode of inheritance seems complex and no genes or mutations have been identified yet.

The project aims to bundle the efforts of different research groups that are currently working on inherited genetic defects in pigs. Through this collaboration a faster identification of the genes and suitable gene markers for use in marker assisted selection against defects in pigs will be obtained. Thereafter, these markers can be implemented in the breeding programs of the different SME partners and can (later) be commercialised, which will improve the competitive position of the SME partners. 

Frame

PIGENDEF is the acronym of the project 'Towards marker assisted selection against genetic defects in pigs'. It is funded by the Seventh Framework Program of the European Community for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities within the framework of the Research for the benefit of small and medium enterprises (SME). The project consortium consists of 3 research partners and 5 SME partners located in 5 different countries.

The PIGENDEF project is coordinated by the research unit Livestock genetics of KU Leuven (Belgium) which is a research partner together with CIGENE, University of Life Sciences (Norway) and University of Liège (Belgium). They provide a successful combination of expert groups in animal genetics, genomics and breeding, bioinformatics, statistical analysis and high throughput genotyping. This provides a solid scientific and applied basis for the PIGENDEF project from the first stages of its design, through performance of its core part, up to the final stages of knowledge and the SME partners’ implementation and dissemination.

The 5 SME partners of the PIGENDEF consortium are companies active in pig breeding. These companies with experience in pig genetic research ensure the availability of resource populations and guarantee the exploitation of the results in favor of the pig breeding community. The two core SME partners, Rattlerow-Seghers N.V. (Belgium) and Norsvin (Norway), are providing samples and datasets of affected piglets and/or unaffected siblings and their parents within their lines. These partners acquire the intellectual property and organize the implementation of the results. The other SME partners, Santa Fosca (Italy), Nordic Genetics (Sweden) and Selección Batallé S.A. (Spain)
